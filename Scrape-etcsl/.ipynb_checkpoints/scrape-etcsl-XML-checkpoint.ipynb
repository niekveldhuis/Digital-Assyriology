    "\n",
    "The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature ([ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk) 1998-2006) provides editions and translations of some 400 Sumerian literary texts. Goal of this Notebook is to format the ETCSL data in such a way that the (lemmatized) texts are made available for computational text analysis. In order to make the data compatible with output scraped from [ORACC](http://oracc.org), the Notebook ETCSL-to-EPSD2 should be run after running the current scraper.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most purposes you do not need to run this scraper, because the final output is made available to you. However, if you need output in a different format or if you wish to know how the output was produced, you may read, adapt, and run this Notebook.\n",

These so-called HTML entities are used in translation, bibliography, and introductory text, but not in the transliteration of the Sumerian text itself (see below). The entities are for the most part project-specific and are declared and described elsewhere in the ETCSL file set. The ElementTree package cannot deal with these entities and thus we have to replace them with the actual (unicode) character that they represent, before feeding the data to ElementTree. \n",

    "\n",
    "The ETCSL web pages include variants, indicated as '(1 ms. has instead: )', with the variant text enclosed in curly brackets. Two types of variants are distinguished: 'additional text' and 'secondary text'. 'Additional text' refers to a line that appears in a minority of sources (often in only one). 'Secondary text' refers to variant words or variant lines that are found in a minority of sources. The function `secondary()` removes the words of 'secondary text' but leaves the 'additional text' in place. \n",

    "The function `secondary()` is called by the function `parse()` (see below, section 8). If you prefer to have both primary and secondary text in your data set, simply remove (or invalidate) the line `xmltext = secondary(xmltext)` in the function `parse()`. Alternatively, remove the '#' before `return xmltext` in the function `secondary()`. As a result the function will return the variable `xmltext` without altering anything."

    "A word in the ETCSL files is represented by a number of nodes in the XML tree that identify the form (transliteration), citation form, guide word, part of speech, etc. The function `getword()` formats the word as closely as possible to the ORACC conventions. Three different types of words are treated in three different ways: Proper Nouns, Sumerian words and Emesal words.\n",

In ORACC a word has a single POS; for proper nouns this is DN, PN, GN, etc. - so what is 'type' in ETCSL becomes POS in ORACC. ORACC proper nouns usually do not have a guide word (only a number to enable disambiguation of namesakes). The ETCSL guide words ('label') for names come pretty close to ORACC citation forms. Names are therefore formatted differently from other nouns.\n",

Transformation of citation forms and guide words to ORACC (epsd2) standards takes place in the Notebook ETCSL-toEPSD2.

Removal of commas will allow the output files to be read as Comma Separated Value (csv) files, which is an efficient input format for processes in Python and R. In the output file commas separate different fields from each other (text ID, text name, line number and text). Spaces need to be removed because standard tokenizers will understand spaces as word dividers. "
